Hello all!

Welcome to my blog! This is just a small space for me to write down and coherently attmept to piece together the knowledge that I gain while doing things in information security.

I have been in the professional IT world for the past 6 years and I am currently a student at Western Governor's University pursuing my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.
